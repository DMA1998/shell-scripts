`./start.sh` it's a main executable file with available option `--target-location` which points to the destination folder where .jar dependencies will be uploaded.

`./start.sh` without an option -> default target location is $HOME/target_(date and time in epoch format) e.g. /Users/admin/target_1704023133.
